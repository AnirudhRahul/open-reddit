# PPRS
PPRS is the Public Python Reddit Scraper, which aims to be a lightweight library used to access publicly available info on reddit.

Currently this package supports scraping:
* Subreddit Information
* Subreddit Icons

The main draw of this python package is that it will work out of the box with, **no** reddit app registration required.
